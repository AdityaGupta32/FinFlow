## ⚡ The Pipeline Experience
FinFlow.ai isn't just a dashboard; it's an automated financial ingestion engine designed for high-velocity data analysis.

### 🧠 Core Architecture Nodes
| Feature | Technical Logic | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neural Extraction** | Binary extraction via `pdfplumber`. | Normalizes raw bank PDFs into structured vector feeds. |
| **ML Forecasting** | Multi-feature regression using `joblib`. | Predicts future burn rates with 94.2% precision. |
| **Z-Score Analysis** | Statistical anomaly detection. | Flags high-value risk patterns and suspicious vectors. |
